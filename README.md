# 101 Donations

## Challenge Statement:

Poverty and Waste. Two problems can be solved at once. Donate to charity. Sounds simple right? But, making a donation is often more tedious than it seems. We aim to turn donating into a seamless process, connecting people with charities and refugee camps.

### Run Locally

1. npm install
2. npm start
3. View app in browser in mobile mode
4. Donators can login as normal. If not registered, will automatically create an account on login. Proceed to http://localhost:3000/charitypostfeed for charity/organization dashboard. For now, donators can only donate to a default charity.
